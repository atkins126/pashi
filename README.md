Source Code
-----------

Up to and including release 2.0 beta 2 of 12 August 2014 the project's source code was maintained in a Subversion repository on GoogleCode. That repo has now been converted to Git and imported to GitHub. Releases have been tagged. Consequently all changes up to release 2.0 beta 2 were made to `master`. Some later changes, up to and including the creation of this ReadMe file were also committed to directly to `master`.

The [Git Flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) methodology has now been adopted. This means that all development work is now done on the `develop` branch or special `feature` branches, leaving `master` in a production ready state.

### Contributions

Contributions are welcome. Just fork the repo and create a feature branch off the `develop` branch. Commit your changes to your feature branch and submit a pull request when ready.
