Usage:
  PasHi { <filename> | <command> }

PasHi takes any number of file names and commands as parameters, in any order.

By default Pascal source code is read from standard input, which may be
redirected. If one or more file names is entered on the command line then input
is taken from the file(s). Multiple files are concatenated before highlighting.
Supported input file encodings are ANSI, UTF-8, UTF-16LE, UTF-16BE. The last
three file types must have appropriate byte order marks at the beginning of the
file.

Unless changed using the options below, output is sent to stdout, which may be
redirected. The default output encoding is UTF-8 with byte order mark.

PasHi supports the following commands:

--branding           -b    Determines if PasHi includes branding information as
                           a comment in XHTML fragments. --branding requires
                           the next parameter to supply one of the following
                           values:
                             yes - include branding [default]
                             no - no branding.
                           Alternatively use -b+ to include branding or -b- to
                           exclude it.
--default-css              Embed the program's default CSS in a <style> tag in
                           XHTML documents [default].
--doc-type           -d    Specifies the output document type, which must be
                           supplied in the next parameter. Values are:
                             xhtml - output complete XHTML document [default]
                             xhtml-fragment - output only a <pre> tag
                               containing the highlighted code
--embed-css          -s    Reads CSS from a file and embeds it in a <style> tag
                           in the output XHTML document. The name of the CSS
                           file must be supplied in the next parameter. File
                           names containing no path information are read from
                           PasHi's application data directory.
--encoding           -e    Specifies the output encoding. The next
                           parameter must provide one of the following values:
                             utf-8 [default]
                             utf-16 (or unicode)
                             windows-1252 (or latin-1)
                             iso-8859-1.
--help               -h    Displays this help screen. Do not use with other
                           commands.
--hide-css           -c    Determines whether any embedded CSS is enclosed in
                           HTML comments to prevent older browsers from
                           displaying it. --hide-css requires the next
                           parameter to supply one of the following values:
                             yes - enclose CSS in comments
                             no - do not enclose CSS [default]
                           Alternatively use -c+ to enclose CSS in comments or
                           -c- not to do so.
--input-clipboard    -r    Read source code from the clipboard instead of stdin
                           or file(s).
--input-stdin              Read source code from stdin [default].
--language           -l    Specifies the language used for the output document.
                           The following parameter must contain a language code
                           that HTML recognises. E.g. "en" or "en-gb".
--language-neutral         Outputs no language information [default].
--legacy-css               Determines which CSS class names are used in the
                           output XHTML document. These can either the current
                           names or the same names used in PasHi v1. The next
                           parameter must supply one of the following values:
                             yes - use PasHi v1 CSS class names
                             no - use current CSS class names [default].
--link-css           -k    Generates a <link> tag in the output XHTML document
                           that references an external CSS file. A full or
                           partial URL must be specified in the next parameter.
--output-clipboard   -w    Writes output to the clipboard as Unicode text.
                           Ignores the --encoding command.
--output-file        -o    Writes output to the file that is named in the
                           following parameter.
--output-stdout            Writes output to stdout [default].
--quiet              -q    Sets quiet mode. Alias for "--verbosity quiet".
--separator-lines          Specifies the number of blank lines to be used to
                           separate source code from multiple input files. The
                           next parameter must specify the number of lines in
                           the range 0..16.
--title              -t    Sets the title used for the output document. The
                           next parameter must contain the required text. To
                           include spaces surround the text in double quotes.
--title-default            Uses the program's default title for the output
                           document [default].
--trim               -m    Determines whether input documents are trimmed of
                           leading and trailing blank lines. --trim requires
                           the next parameter to supply one of the following
                           values:
                             yes - trim [default]
                             no - do not trim
                           Alternatively use -m+ to trim or -m- to prevent
                           trimming.
--verbosity                Specifies the amount of output from the program.
                           The next parameter must specify one of:
                             normal - sign-on, error and completion messages
                               [default]
                             quiet - error messages only

Default commands can be changed by editing the "config" file stored in PasHi's
application data directory. Commands are listed one per line and have the same
names as the long form commands above, but without the leading "--". If a
command takes a parameter it must be entered on the same line as the command
and separated from it by one or more spaces. Parameters containing spaces must
not be enclosed in quotes.

PasHi's application data directory is %AppData%\DelphiDabbler\PasHi.
