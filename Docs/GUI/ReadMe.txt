What Is PasHiGUI?
________________________________________________________________________________

PasHiGUI is a graphical front end for the PasHi Pascal Syntax Highlighter
command line program. PasHiGUI requires that PasHi is installed either in the
same directory as PasHiGUI or that PasHi is on the system path.
