Release ???
PasHi v??? build 9
  + Improved Pascal syntax highlighter:
    - Understands Delphi 2010 keywords and directives.
    - Support added for context sensitive directives which are now highlighted only within property, exports and external statements.
    - Keywords prefixed with '&' are now treated as identifiers, not reserved words.
    - Fixes some bugs that caused parser to crash when unuexpected characters encountered. 
    - Major refactoring of code.
  + Unicode now support throughout program:
    - UTF-8 is now default encoding instead of default ANSI code page, except for messages written to stderr which remain ANSI.
    - UTF-16 little endian & big endian, UTF-8 and default ANSI code page input now supported. Auto-detected using byte order marks in files.
    - Clipboard is always read and written in Unicode.
  + Input can now be read directly from files passed on command line. Where more one file is specified, files are concatenated before highlighting.
  + Changes to generated XHTML files:
    - Output file encoding can now be specified with default changed to UTF-8. Files have correct byte order mark and encoding is added to XHTML document in <?xml?> processing instruction and content type meta tag.
    - Language used for output files can now be specified by user and included <html> tags.
    - Custom style sheets can now be either embedded <style> documents or be linked to via <link> tags.
    - Document title can be specified by user.
    - "Branding" (HTML comment declaring PasHi as generator) can be inhibited in XHTML fragments.
  + Output file name can now be specified on command line as an option to using shell redirection.
  + Command line commands were standardised with both an long and short form for each command, with-support for form used in v1.x retained as aliases. Some existing commands were modified to be more flexible. These are documented in ReadMe file.
  + Recompiled with Delphi 2010
  + Significant refactoring, especially in syntax highlighter, input/output and command line parsing.
  + Updated documentation
  + Changed source code to Mozilla Public License v2.0.
PasHiGUI v??? build 3
  + Program now has full Unicode support:
    - Detects and correctlt handles Unicode or ANSI output from PasHi on stdout (ANSI output continues from PasHi stderr).
    - Correctly handles ANSI, UTF-8 or UTF-18 encoded Pascal files using byte order mark.
    - Code fragment template now uses UTF-8 encoding.
    - Both ANSI and Unicode text can be read from clipboard, with preference for Unicode.
    - Clipboard is always written to in Unicode.
    - Fixed code that displays HTML in browser control to handle Unicode correctly.
    - Names of files dragged and dropped or copies and pasted can either be ANSI or Unicode.
  + Command line passed to PasHi modified to be more explicit and to use new PasHi commands.
  + A little refactoring.
  + Recompiled with Delphi 2010
  + Changed source code to Mozilla Public License v2.0.
