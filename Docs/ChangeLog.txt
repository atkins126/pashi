Release 2.0 beta 1
PasHi v1.99.1 build 9
  + Improved Pascal syntax highlighter:
    - Understands Delphi 2010 keywords and directives.
    - Support added for context sensitive directives which are now highlighted only within property, exports and external statements.
    - Keywords prefixed with '&' are now treated as identifiers, not reserved words.
    - Fixes some bugs that caused parser to crash when unexpected characters encountered.
    - Major refactoring of code.
  + Unicode now supported throughout program:
    - UTF-8 is now default encoding instead of default ANSI code page, except for messages written to stderr which remain ANSI.
    - UTF-16 little endian & big endian, UTF-8 and default ANSI code page input now supported: auto-detected using byte order marks.
    - Clipboard is always read and written in Unicode.
  + Input can now be read directly from files passed on command line. Where more than one file is specified, files are concatenated before highlighting.
  + Number of blank lines separating files can be specified.
  + Input source code can optionally have leading and trailing blank lines removed.
  + Source code can now be preceeded by line numbers.
  + Alterate source code lines can now be styled differently.
  + Changes to generated XHTML files:
    - Output file encoding can now be specified (default changed to UTF-8). Files have correct byte order mark and encoding is added to XHTML document in <?xml?> processing instruction and content type meta tag.
    - Layout of generated HTML changed: a <div> surrounds all code and a <pre> is used for each line.
    - Language used for output files can now be specified by user and is included in <html> tags.
    - Custom style sheets can now be either embedded in generated documents or be linked via <link> tags.
    - Document title can be specified by user.
    - "Branding" (comments or meta tags declaring PasHi as generator) can be inhibited.
    - Generated HTML files can now be in HTML 4 and HTML 5 in addition to XHTML and HTML fragments.
    - New CSS class names now used but backwards compatibilty retained.
  + Output file name can now be specified on command line as an alternative to using shell redirection.
  + Commands were standardised with both an long and short form for each command, with some non-conformant commands used in v1.x retained as aliases. Some existing commands were modified to be more flexible. Many new commands. These are documented in the ReadMe file.
  + Default behaviour can now be specified using a config file in user application data directory. Some new commands provided to override config file and return some options to original default behaviour.
  + Help screen greatly expanded to cover all new options.
  + Clipboard related bug fixed.
  + Significant refactoring, especially in syntax highlighter, input/output, HTML document rendering and command line parsing.
  + Updated documentation.
PasHiGUI v0.99.1 build 3
  + Now requires PasHi v2 beta or later.
  + UI changes:
    - "Source Code" tab removed from display: input source code is no longer displayed.
    - Options to be passed to PasHi can now be set in new "Options Side Bar" displayed at the right of the main window. The side bar can be hidden or displayed when required.

    - A new styling is used to display HTML code fragments using new CSS class names supported by PasHi.
    - Menus and toolbar revised re program changes.
    - Main window now constrained to a minimum size.
  + Multiple file names can now be passed to PasHi via multiple selection in file open dialog box or by dragging and dropping from Explorer.
  + Input files are now passed directly to the PasHi command line rather than being opened and sent to PasHi via a pipe.
  + Interaction with PasHi changed to permit PasHiGUI defaults and user defined options to be passed on command line.
  + New config file for storing options entered in Options Side Bar.
  + Online documentation can now be accessed from Help menu.
  + Some refactoring.
