Release ???
PasHi v??? build 9
  + Improved Pascal syntax highlighter:
    - Understands Delphi 2010 keywords and directives.
    - Support added for context sensitive directives which are now highlighted only within property, exports and external statements.
    - Keywords prefixed with '&' are now treated as identifiers, not reserved words.
    - Fixes some bugs that caused parser to crash when unexpected characters encountered.
    - Major refactoring of code.
  + Unicode now supported throughout program:
    - UTF-8 is now default encoding instead of default ANSI code page, except for messages written to stderr which remain ANSI.
    - UTF-16 little endian & big endian, UTF-8 and default ANSI code page input now supported: auto-detected using byte order marks.
    - Clipboard is always read and written in Unicode.
  + Input can now be read directly from files passed on command line. Where more than one file is specified, files are concatenated before highlighting.
  + Number of blank lines separating files can be specified.
  + Input source code can optionally have leading and trailing blank lines removed.
  + Source code can now be preceeded by line numbers.
  + Alterate source code lines can now be styled differently.
  + Changes to generated XHTML files:
    - Output file encoding can now be specified (default changed to UTF-8). Files have correct byte order mark and encoding is added to XHTML document in <?xml?> processing instruction and content type meta tag.
    - Layout of generated HTML changed: a <div> surrounds all code and a <pre> is used for each line.
    - Language used for output files can now be specified by user and is included in <html> tags.
    - Custom style sheets can now be either embedded in generated documents or be linked via <link> tags.
    - Document title can be specified by user.
    - "Branding" (comments or meta tags declaring PasHi as generator) can be inhibited.
    - Generated HTML files can now be in HTML 4 and HTML 5 in addition to XHTML and HTML fragments.
    - New CSS class names now used but backwards compatibilty retained.
  + Output file name can now be specified on command line as an alternative to using shell redirection.
  + Commands were standardised with both an long and short form for each command, with some non-conformant commands used in v1.x retained as aliases. Some existing commands were modified to be more flexible. Many new commands. These are documented in the ReadMe file.
  + Default behaviour can now be specified using a config file in user application data directory. Some new commands provided to override config file and return some options to original default behaviour.
  + Help screen greatly expanded to cover all new options.
  + Clipboard related bug fixed.
  + Significant refactoring, especially in syntax highlighter, input/output, HTML document rendering and command line parsing.
  + Updated documentation.
PasHiGUI v??? build 3
  + Input source code no longer displayed: "Source Code" tab removed from display.
  + Input files are now passed directly to the PasHi command line rather than being opened and sent to PasHi via a pipe.
  + Some commands passed to PasHi to override its config file and ensure behaviour expected by PasHiGUI.
  + Multiple file names can now be passed to PasHi:
    - Open file dialogue box permits multiple file selection.
    - Multiple files can be dragged and dropped or copied and pasted from Explorer.
  + Program now has full Unicode support:
    - Detects and correctly handles Unicode or ANSI output from PasHi on stdout. (PasHi continues to use ANSI on stderr).
    - Any source code piped to PasHi is in UTF-8 format.
    - Code fragment template now uses UTF-8 encoding.
    - Both ANSI and Unicode source code can be read from clipboard or dragged & dropped text, with preference for Unicode.
    - Clipboard is always written to in Unicode.
    - Code that displays HTML in browser control now handles Unicode correctly.
    - Unicode file names now supported, including in drag-drop or copy/paste.
  + New configuration options:
    - New "Options Side Bar" added where all relevant PasHi options can be configured. This is displayed at right hand edge of screen and contains a collapsible list of option categories.
    - New config file for PasHiGUI where options entered in Options Side Bar are recorded.
    - "Fragment" tool button and menu item removed.
    - New "Show / Hide Option" tool button and menu item added.
    - Can restore PasHi default options (per its config file).
  + Removed Options | Show Hints menu option and facility to display hints in status bar.
  + Removed status bar.
  + Changed code that handles calling PasHi to work with, and take advantage of new PasHi command line options.
  + Changed styling used to display code fragments. Now uses new CSS class names supported by PasHi.
  + Some refactoring.
Miscellaneous
  + New installer program:
    - Installs PasHi and, optionally PasHiGUI.
    - Optionally installs sample CSS files and config file templates.
    - Optionally adds PasHi's install directory to all-user system path *uninstaller removes).
    - Creates start menu program group.
