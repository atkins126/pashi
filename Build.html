<h1>
  PasHi Build Instructions
</h1>

<h2>
  Introduction
</h2>

<p>
  These instructions show how to build the <em>PasHi</em> command line program
  and, optionally, <em>PasHiGUI</em> - the GUI front end to <em>PasHi</em>.
</p>

<p>
  The programs are written in Object Pascal and are targeted at Delphi XE.
</p>

<p>
  The Delphi IDE can be used to modify the source and to perform test builds.
  Final builds should be built using the provided makefiles.
</p>

<div class="box">

  <p>
    <strong>Note:</strong>
    These instructions do not apply to versions of the program before release
    v2.0.0.
  </p>

</div>

<h2>
  Dependencies
</h2>

<h3>
  Libraries
</h3>

<h4>
  PasHi
</h4>

<p>
  No libraries are required to build <em>PasHi</em>
</p>

<h4>
  PasHiGUI
</h4>

<p>
  <em>PasHiGUI</em> requires <code>PJWdwState.pas</code> from the DelphiDabbler
  Window State Components, v5.6.1 or later. A copy of the required file is
  included in the <code>Src\GUI\Imported</code> directory. There is no need to
  install the components into the DelphiIDE.
</p>

<h3>
  Delphi VCL
</h3>

<p>
  You need the relevant Delphi VCL in order to compile the programs.
</p>

<h2>
  Build Tools
</h2>

<p>
  The following tools are needed to build the programs.
</p>

<h3>
  Delphi
</h3>

<p>
  A copy of Delphi is required to build the object Pascal code. Delphi XE is the
  preferred compiler.
</p>

<div class="box">
  The code should be able to compile with Delphi XE and later. It is possible
  that Delphi 2009 may compile the code, but it hasn't been tested. Versions
  earlier than Delphi 2009 are not suitable due to their lack of Unicode
  support.
</div>

<p>
  You can use the Delphi IDE to edit the code and test compile it. The
  makefiles require the following command line tools:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt class="spaced">
    <code>DCC32</code>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      The Delphi command line compiler.
    </p>
    <div class="box">
      Not available with starter editions of Delphi.
    </div>
  </dd>
  <dt class="spaced">
    <code>RC</code>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      The Microsoft resource compiler. Used to compile the main resource file.
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt class="spaced">
    <code>BRCC32</code>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      The Borland resource compiler. Used to compile version information
      resources from temporary resource files emitted by VIEd (see below).
    </p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<div class="box">
  We use two different resource compilers because <code>RC</code> fails to
  compile resource files emitted by the Version Information Editor while
  <code>BRCC32</code> can fail to compile <code>.manifest</code> files
  correctly.
</div>

<p>
  The following environment variables are associated with these tools:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt class="spaced">
    <code>DELPHIROOT</code> - required unless <code>DELPHIXE</code> is set.
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Should be set to the install directory of the version of Delphi being
      used. <code>DCC32</code>, <code>BRCC32</code> and <code>RC</code> are
      expected to be in the <code>Bin</code> sub-directory of
      <code>DELPHIROOT</code>.
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt class="spaced">
    <code>DELPHIXE</code> - optional
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      If you are using Delphi XE this environment variable may be set to its
      install directory. When <code>DELPHIXE</code> is specified
      <code>DELPHIROOT</code> will be ignored and <code>DELPHIXE</code> will be
      used instead.
    </p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<h3>
  Borland MAKE
</h3>

<p>
  This is the make tool that ships with Delphi. You can use any version that
  works.
</p>

<h3>
  DelphiDabbler Version Information Editor (VIEd)
</h3>

<p>
  This tool is used to compile version information (<code>.vi</code>) files
  into intermediate resource source (<code>.rc</code>) files. Version 2.11.2
  or later is required. Version Information Editor can be obtained from
  <a
    href="http://delphidabbler.com/software/vied"
  >http://delphidabbler.com/software/vied</a>.
</p>

<p>
  The program is expected to be on the path unless its install directory is
  specified by the <code>VIEDROOT</code> environment variable.
</p>

<h3>
  Inno Setup
</h3>

<p>
  The Unicode version on the Inno setup command line compiler is needed to
  create <em>CodeSnip</em>'s install program. v5.4.0 (u) or later is required as
  is a compatible version of the ISPP pre-processor. You can get Inno Setup with
  ISPP at <a
    href="http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php"
  >http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php</a>. Choose the Unicode version. If you
  already have the ANSI version the Unicode version can be installed alongside
  it - just use a different install directory and program group name.
</p>

<p>
  The program is expected to be on the path unless its install directory is
  specified by the <code>INNOSETUP</code> environment variable.
</p>

<h3>
  Zip
</h3>

<p>
  This program is used to create release files. You can get a Windows command
  line version at
  <a
    href="http://stahlforce.com/dev/index.php?tool=zipunzip"
  >http://stahlforce.com/dev/index.php?tool=zipunzip</a>.
</p>

<p>
  The program is expected to be on the path unless its install directory is
  specified by the <code>ZIPROOT</code> environment variable.
</p>

<h2>
  Preparation
</h2>

<h3>
  Configure the environment.
</h3>

<p>
  The first step is to configure the required <code>DELPHIROOT</code> or
  <code>DELPHIXE</code> environment variables.
</p>

<p>
  Next, set any of the optional <code>VIEDROOT</code>, <code>INNOSETUP</code>
  and <code>ZIPROOT</code> environment variables that are needed to specify the
  path to any tools that are not on the system path.
</p>

<p>
  You can configure environment variables either by modifying your system
  environment variables or by creating a batch file that you run before
  performing the build.
</p>

<h3>
  Get the Source Code
</h3>

<p>
  If you don't already have it, you need to get the <em>PasHi</em> source code,
  (which includes the source for <em>PasHiGUI</em>).
</p>

<p>
  The source code is maintained in the <a
    href="https://github.com/delphidabbler/pashi"
  >delphidabbler/pashi</a> Git repository on GitHub. Either clone or fork the
  repo into a directory on your computer.
</p>

<p>
  Source code for <em>PasHi</em>'s latest release can be found in the
  <em>master</em> branch while development code is maintained in the
  <em>develop</em> branch. New features are developed in branches whose name
  begins with <em>feature</em>. You can also download the code of one of the
  releases by selecting the relevant tag.
</p>

<p class="box">
  If you want to submit any modifications to the source code, please create a
  new feature branch off the <em>develop</em> branch, commit your modifications
  to it and then submit a pull request on GitHub.
</p>

<h3>
  Configure the Source Tree
</h3>

<p>
  After obtaining the source code you should have the following directory
  structure:
</p>

<pre>./
  |
  +-- Config                - config files to be installed with PasHi
  |
  +-- Docs                  - documentation
  |
  +-- Src                   - source code for PasHi
  |   |
  |   +-- Assets            - assets required to build PasHi's resources
  |   |
  |   +-- GUI               - source code of the GUI application, PasHiGUI
  |   |   |
  |   |   +-- Assets        - assets required to build PasHiGUI's resources
  |   |   |
  |   |   +-- Imported      - 3rd party source code used for GUI application
  |   |
  |   +-- Install           - install program scripts
  |
  +-- Test                  - contains test file</pre>

<p>
  Don't worry if you also have a <code>Build</code> directory and
  sub-directories - all will become clear.
</p>

<p>
  Before you can get hacking, you need to prepare the source code tree. Open a
  command console and run any script you have created to set the required
  environment variables. Then navigate into the <code>Src</code> sub-folder and
  do:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">Src&gt;</span> Make config</pre>

<p>
  You may need to replace <code>Make</code> with the full path to
  <code>Make</code> if it isn't on the path, or if the <code>Make</code> that
  runs isn't the Borland / CodeGear / Embarcadero version. If this is the case
  try:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">Src&gt;</span> %DELPHIROOT%\Bin\Make config</pre>

<p>
  or
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">Src&gt;</span> %DELPHIXE%\Bin\Make config</pre>

<p>
  depending on which environment variable you have set.
</p>

<p>
  Once <code>Make config</code> has completed, your folder structure should
  have acquired the following new folders:
</p>

<pre>./
  <strong>+-- Build                 - receives all files created by the build process
  |   |
  |   +-- Bin               - receives object files and .res files for PasHi
  |   |
  |   +-- Exe               - receives executable code
  |   |
  |   +-- Release           - receives release files</strong>
  <span class="disabled">|
  +-- Config                - config files to be installed with PasHi
  |
  +-- Docs                  - documentation
  |
  +-- Src                   - source code for PasHi
  |   |
  |   +-- Assets            - assets required to build PasHi's resources
  |   |
  |   +-- GUI               - source code of the GUI application, PasHiGUI
  |   |   |
  |   |   +-- Assets        - assets required to build PasHiGUI's resources
  |   |   |
  |   |   +-- Imported      - 3rd party source code used for GUI application
  |   |
  |   +-- Install           - install program scripts
  |
  +-- Test                  - contains test file</span></pre>

<p>
  <code>Make</code> will have created a <code>.cfg</code> file from the template
  in the <code>Src</code> folder. <code>.cfg</code> files are needed for DCC32
  to run correctly. This new file will be ignored by Git.
</p>

<p>
  If you also want to compile <em>PasHiGUI</em> you must now do:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">Src&gt;</span> cd GUI
<span class="prompt">Src\GUI&gt;</span> Make config
<span class="prompt">Src\GUI&gt;</span> cd ..</pre>

<p>
  This runs a separate makefile in the GUI directory and further configures
  the source tree to enable <em>PasHiGUI</em> to be compiled. The source tree
  should have been changed slightly to look like this:
</p>

<pre>./
  <span class="disabled">+-- Build                 - receives all files created by the build process
  |   |
  |   +-- Bin               - receives object files and .res files for PasHi
  |   |</span>   <strong>|</strong>
  <span class="disabled">|   |</span>   <strong>+-- GUI           - receives object files and .res files for PasHiGUI</strong>
  <span class="disabled">|   |
  |   +-- Exe               - receives executable code
  |   |
  |   +-- Release           - receives release files
  |
  +-- Config                - config files to be installed with PasHi
  |
  +-- Docs                  - documentation
  |
  +-- Src                   - source code for PasHi
  |   |
  |   +-- Assets            - assets required to build PasHi's resources
  |   |
  |   +-- GUI               - source code of the GUI application, PasHiGUI
  |   |   |
  |   |   +-- Assets        - assets required to build PasHiGUI's resources
  |   |   |
  |   |   +-- Imported      - 3rd party source code used for GUI application
  |   |
  |   +-- Install           - install program scripts
  |
  +-- Test                  - contains test file</span></pre>

<p>
  <code>Make</code> will also have created the required <code>.cfg</code> file
  in the <code>Src\GUI</code> directory.
</p>

<p>
  If you are intending to use the Delphi IDE to compile <em>PasHi</em>, you
  should also do:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">Src&gt;</span> Make resources</pre>

<p>
  and, for <em>PasHiGUI</em>:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">Src&gt;</span> cd GUI
<span class="prompt">Src\GUI&gt;</span> Make resources
<span class="prompt">Src\GUI&gt;</span> cd ..</pre>

<p>
  This compiles the resource files that the IDE needs to link into compiled
  executables.
</p>

<p>
  You are now ready to build the source.
</p>

<h2>
  Building The Programs
</h2>

<h3>
  Creating The Executables
</h3>

<p>
  Once the source tree has been configured, and before you can build the
  Pascal code, you must create the program's resources. For <em>PasHi</em> do:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">Src&gt;</span> Make resources</pre>

<p>
  and for <em>PasHiGUI</em> do:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">Src&gt;</span> cd GUI
<span class="prompt">Src\GUI&gt;</span> Make resources
<span class="prompt">Src\GUI&gt;</span> cd ..</pre>

<p>
  And now you can build the Pascal code:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">Src&gt;</span> Make pascal</pre>

<p>
  or
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">Src&gt;</span> cd GUI
<span class="prompt">Src\GUI&gt;</span> Make pascal
<span class="prompt">Src\GUI&gt;</span> cd ..</pre>

<p>
  Should you want to build an executable from a clean source tree there is a
  shortcut. Simply running:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make</pre>

<p>
  on its own is the same as doing:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make config
<span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make resources
<span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make pascal</pre>

<p>
  So, to build <em>PasHi</em> and <em>PasHiGUI</em> and place
  <code>PasHi.exe</code> and <code>PasHiGUI.exe</code> in the
  <code>Build\Exe</code> folder do this:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">Src&gt;</span> Make
<span class="prompt">Src&gt;</span> cd GUI
<span class="prompt">Src\GUI&gt;</span> Make
<span class="prompt">Src\GUI&gt;</span> cd ..</pre>

<p>
  There's a shortcut for building <em>PasHiGUI</em>: using the main makefile
  just do:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">Src&gt;</span> Make pashigui</pre>

<p>
  When both the <em>PasHi</em> and <em>PasHiGUI</em> executables have been built
  you can create the setup program. This is done from the main makefile with:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">Src&gt;</span> Make setup</pre>

<h3>
  Creating the Release zip file
</h3>

<p>
  Once the setup program has been generated you can create a zip file containing
  the setup program and the required documentation files. You create the zip
  by doing:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">Src&gt;</span> Make release</pre>

<p>
  Note that this only works with the makefile in the <code>Src</code> directory:
  the <code>release</code> target is not supported by
  <code>Src\GUI\Makefile</code>.
</p>

<p>
  By default the release file is called <code>dd-pashi.zip</code>. You can
  change this name by defining the <code>RELEASEFILENAME</code> enviroment
  variable or macro. For example, you can name the release
  <code>MyRelease.zip</code> by doing:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">Src&gt;</span> Make -DRELEASEFILENAME=MyRelease release</pre>

<p>
  Release zip files are always placed in the <code>Build\Release</code>
  directory.
</p>

<h3>
  One-shot Build and Release
</h3>

<p>
  When you are ready to create a release there is a shortcut you can use to
  configure the source tree, build the executables and the setup program, and
  finally package the release zip file. Use the following command:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">Src&gt;</span> Make all</pre>

<p>
  Once again you can change the release file name using the
  <code>RELEASEFILENAME</code> environment variable or macro:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">Src&gt;</span> Make -DRELEASEFILENAME=MyRelease all</pre>

<h2>
  Clean Up
</h2>

<p>
  Various temporary files and directories are created by the IDE. These can be
  deleted by running:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">Src&gt;</span> Make clean</pre>

<p>
  This command is only available in the makefile in the <code>Src</code>
  directory and acts on the whole source tree, including the <code>GUI</code>
  sub-tree.
</p>

<p>
  Be warned that this command removes the <code>__history</code> folders that
  Delphi uses to record earlier versions of files.
</p>

<p>
  <code>Make clean</code> leaves behind the files and directories created by
  <code>Make config</code>. To delete these files and directories in addition to
  performing a normal clean run:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">Src&gt;</span> Make deepclean</pre>

<p>
  Once again this command operates on both the <code>Src</code> and
  <code>Src\GUI</code> directories.
</p>

<h2>
  Testing
</h2>

<p>
  A test file, named <code>Test.pas</code>, is provided in the <code>Test</code>
  directory. This file can be used to test the output of <em>PasHi</em>. It
  contains some unusual but valid constructs that push the program to its
  limits.
</p>

<p>
  <code>Test.pas</code> was not designed to compile, so do not add it to the
  project.
</p>
