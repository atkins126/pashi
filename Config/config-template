# PasHi config file template
# --------------------------
#
# PURPOSE
# -------
#
# PasHi looks for a file named config in the %AppData%\DelphiDabbler\PasHi when
# it starts up. Any commands it finds in that file can be used to change the
# program's default state. By default there is no config: the user must provide
# one if needed.
#
# This file is provided as a template for creating a config file. As provided,
# it makes makes no changes to PasHi's default state. However it is fully
# commented and lists every available configuration option.
#
# Possible commands are noted below. For an explanation of each command, and its
# permitted parameters (if any) see the command reference in ReadMe.html.
#
# FILE FORMAT
# -----------
#
# Each command must be placed on its own line. Any parameters required by the
# command must follow the command and be separated from it by one or more
# spaces. Parameters containing spaces must not be enclosed in quotes.
#
# Blank lines are ignored, as are lines beginning with #. Leading and trailing
# spaces and tabs are also ignored.
#
# The file must be saved in UTF-8 encoding, with or without BOM (byte order
# mark).
#
# WARNING: Errors in this file will crash PasHi. The program can usually work
# out if an error was caused by this file and will report the fact in its error
# message.
#
