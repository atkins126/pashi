# PasHi config file for backards compatibility with PasHi v1
# ----------------------------------------------------------
#
# PURPOSE
# -------
#
# This file reverts PasHi to as near as possible the default behaviour of PasHi
# version 1, with the following exceptions:
#
#  - Output encoding is windows-1252 (nearest available option to the older
#    program's use of system default ANSI encoding).
#
#  - Generated HTML code differs from that generated by PasHi v1, although,
#    providing the correct style sheets are used, the appearance is the same.
#
#  - Any input file encoding supported by PasHi v2 and later will be accepted:
#    PasHi v1 only accepted the default ANSI encoding.
#
#  - There may have been upper and / or lower margins in the output HTML due to
#    the <pre> block that contained all the output with PasHi v1. PasHi v2 uses
#    a <div> block instead that has no margins. The difference will depend on
#    your browser defaults.
#
# FILE FORMAT
# -----------
#
# Each command must be placed on its own line. Any parameters required by the
# command must follow the command and be separated from it by one or more
# spaces. Parameters containing spaces must not be enclosed in quotes.
#
# Blank lines are ignored, as are lines beginning with #. Leading and trailing
# spaces and tabs are also ignored.

# message.
