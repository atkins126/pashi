# PasHi config file
# -----------------
#
# This file must be saved in UTF-8 encoding, with or without BOM (byte order
# mark).
#
# This file configures PasHi and is used to set its default state. Any command
# that is valid on the command line has an equivalent in this config file,
# except that input file names cannot be specified.
#
# Commands have the same name as the long form commands used on the command line
# except that they do not have the leading "--" characters. Commands that expect
# a following parameter must be followed by the parameter value on the same
# line.
#
# Command line commands override commands in this file.
#
# Blank lines are ignored as are lines beginning with # are ignored. Leading and
# trailing spaces and tabs are also ignored.
#
# Errors in this file will crash PasHi. The program can usually work out if an
# error was caused by this file and will report the fact in its error message.
